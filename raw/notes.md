# Notes

> We have constructed a large database of Austro- nesian basic vocabulary (23, 26), which stores 210 items of basic vocabulary from each lan- guage, including words for animals, kinship terms, simple verbs, colors, and numbers. Basic vocabu- lary is both relatively stable over time and gener- ally less likely to be borrowed between languages (27). From this database, a team of linguists iden- tified the sets of homologous words (“cognates”) following the linguistic comparative method (28). We extracted the cognate sets for 400 well- attested languages for analysis. These languages comprise a third of the entire family and include a representative sample of each recognized Aus- tronesian subgroup.
